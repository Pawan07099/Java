There are two types of Programming language
:--procedure oriented Programming Language
:--object oriented Programming Language

(POP)Procedure Oriented Programming Language
-----it tries to emphasis more on function than data value
-----In this concept is divided into various function
-----overloading is not possible and is less secure

(OOP)Object Oriented Programming Language
-----it tries to emphasis more on data value than function
-----In this language it divides into various data known OBJECTS
-----Overloading is possible and also is more Secure

There are various principles followed by OOP
:-Data Abstraction
---It is act of representing essential feature without knowing the background detail.
:-Encapsulation
---Wrapping of data and function of an object as a unit that can be used together in a specific operation is called encapsulation.
:-Inheritance
---Inheriting data from one class to another classs is called as Inheritance.
:-Polymorphism
---Single function to carry multiple task is called as polymorphism.


Class:-
---It is a blueprint for creating object.
Eg--public class Basics {

}

object:-
---it is a instance of a class.
Eg-public class  {
new obj = obj car;(object inside class).


There are three types of variable:
local variable(it is deClared in inside the body of the method)
static variable(A variable that is declared as staic is called as static variable)
instance variable(a variable is declared in a class but outside the body of method)


Types of Operators:
1)Arithmetical Operator:- +,_,*,/,%
2)Logical Operator:- &&,||,!
3)Relational operator:- <,<=,>,>=,==,!=

ASCII(American Standard Code For Information Interchange)
A to Z = 65-90
a to z = 97-122
blank = 32
0 to 9 = 48-57

Token:-
It is individual component of java program and which has some meaning and takes active part while Execution.
There are different types of token:-(Literals,Operators,Identifiers,Punctuators,Seperators,Keywords,Assignment)
   
                              Primitive Data type
Numeric Data type                                          Non Numeric Type
1)Integers                                                 1)Character    
2)Floating                                                 2)Boolean


Integers---byte(1 byte)
           short(2 byte)
           int(4 byte)
           long(8 byte) 
Floating---float(4 byte)
       	   Double(8 byte)

                              Non primitive Data type
Class                                Array                        Interface

types Of conversion
1) implicit conversion(lower byte to higher byte)
2) Explicit conversion(user's choice)

Unary plus(+)
unary minus(-)
increment(++)-[Prefix & postfix] 
decrement(--)
